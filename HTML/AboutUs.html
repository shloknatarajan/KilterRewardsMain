                <p>This website was founded by team 6127, the iBots. We are a private team based in Wildwood, MO and created this as a part of our community outreach program.</p>
            <h1 id="aboutuswhy">Our Purpose</h1>
                <p>In the past, we focused on finding people interested in forming or joining a team and facilitating their transition into robotics, however, we have a limited amount of resources and would not be able to help people farther away. Starting an FTC team isn't easy and can be a daunting task. With this website, we hope to connect anyone interested in FIRST with a team in the area to make creating or joining a team as smooth of a process as possible.</p>
