Kilter itself is not a gym, fitness studio or service provider and does not own, operate or control any of the classes, services or facilities accessible through the Site.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">b) Kilter “Marketplace.” </span><span class="c2">Within the Kilter platform, there exists a marketplace for which we may promote discounts towards products and other services offered by Rewards Partners that may include gyms, fitness studios, apparel companies, nutritional companies, restaurants, coffee shops and many more. We do not represent that we are official partners with any of these locations, unless otherwise noted and are not responsible for the conduct through which you interact with them. In addition, some of the offers promoted on the Kilter platform require a follow up on the business’ end to you as a user. Kilter is not responsible for communicating to or following up with a business on your behalf if they do not contact you. It is your responsibility to communicate with them if you have any issues with a specific promotion offered through Kilter, unless that offer is for purchase directly on the Kilter platform.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">c) &nbsp;Membership Plans.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;We offer a number of membership subscription plans, including special promotional plans or memberships, with differing conditions and limitations. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered membership plans.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">d) Participation and Allocation.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Kilter does not guarantee the participation of particular Rewards Partner locations with point redemption, classes or other services, and availability may change over time. The type, quantity, allocation and availability of participating Rewards Partners, redemptions, classes, packs, memberships, and other inventory offered are determined by Rewards Partners. Kilter may have the authority to offer redemptions towards Rewards Partners based on the partnership agreement with that Rewards Partner. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">e) Use of Kilter.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Your Kilter account is personal to you and you agree not to create more than one account. Kilter may not be used for commercial purposes. To use your Kilter membership, you must have access to the Internet. We continually update and test various aspects of the Kilter platform. We reserve the right to, and by using our service you agree that we may, include you in or exclude you from these tests without notice.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4">3. Billing</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">a)</span><span class="c27">&nbsp;</span><span class="c27">Recurring Billing.</span><span class="c21">&nbsp;Basic Kilter accounts are free, but we offer premium membership subscription plans for users. By starting a Kilter premium membership subscription, you authorize us to charge you for your initial membership period and a recurring monthly membership fee at the then current rate, which may change from time to time. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month may vary for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers and/or changing or adding a plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed monthly in one or more charges. You also authorize us to charge you any other fees you may incur in connection with your use of the Site, such </span><span class="c21">as any applicable sign-up fee, taxes and cancellation or late fees, as further explained below.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">b) Billing Cycle.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;When you sign up and purchase your Kilter subscription, your first subscription cycle will be billed immediately. Your subscription will automatically renew each month and you will be billed on the same date each month. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing (and if we do, we’ll make adjustments to the amounts we charge, as appropriate). In the event that your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your Kilter membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your membership.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">c) Refunds.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Generally, our fees (including the monthly fee for your membership and any other fees) are nonrefundable, except that we will provide a refund to members for their current prepaid period in the following circumstances: (i) if you are canceling your subscription and request a refund within 14 days of your initial purchase or (ii) if your subscription is cancelled prior to the end of a period for which you have incurred a charge, due to your relocation, disability or death; provided, however, in each case we reserve the right to charge a fee to cover the cost of any service (i.e. reward redemption) you may have used prior to your cancellation, to the extent permitted by law (such fee charges not to exceed the cost of the subscription itself). Any additional discounts or refunds that we may choose to provide are in our sole discretion and do not entitle you to any future discounts or refunds in the future for similar instances.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">d) Price Changes.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;We reserve the right to adjust pricing at any time. Unless we expressly communicate otherwise, any price changes to your membership will take effect on your next billing cycle upon notice communicated through a posting on the Kilter website or mobile applicable or such other means as we may deem appropriate from time to time, such as email.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">e) Payment Methods.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You may edit your Payment Method information by logging online and editing it under "My Account" and then "Settings". If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, “Cancellation” below), you nonetheless will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated, including in the event you attempt to create a new account. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. If we cannot charge your account, we reserve the right, but are not obligated, to terminate your access to our Site or any portion thereof.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">f) Cancellation of Membership.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You may terminate your monthly subscription at any time with 3 days’ notice by going into your account settings on the Kilter website, or within your phone settings if you’ve subscribed via the app, and canceling. Following any cancellation, you will continue to have access to your subscription through the end of your current prepaid billing period, unless you cancel and receive a refund, in which case your access will be terminated immediately. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">g) Cancellation Charges for Premium Reward Redemptions.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Should you cancel your membership within the refund period after having redeemed a premium reward, you will be charged the full amount of the premium reward. Should you be a monthly membership plan holder and redeem a premium reward, you will be charged the full amount of the premium reward if you cancel within the first month of your membership. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">h) Hold.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;In lieu of cancellation, we also may give you the option to put your membership on hold at any time, subject to a reduced fee per Membership Cycle. Please request a hold at least 3 days prior to your next billing date if you want to put your membership on hold. (i.e., if your next billing date is September 30th, notify Kilter that you want to put your membership on hold by September 27th.)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">i) Gifts and Promotions.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;From time to time we may make available gift cards for Kilter membership, other types of promotions or promotional plans (including through the use of promotional codes or those provided as part of a third party promotion). Promotions and promotional plans may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the promotion and may be subject to additional or different terms. Unless otherwise expressly communicated to you in connection with your redemption, promotions and promotional plans are only available to new customers that have never had a Kilter account before, are not transferable, can only be used once, cannot be redeemed for cash, and may not be combined with other offers and are void where prohibited. To be eligible for certain promotions, your subscription may not be on “hold”.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c26">4. Other Fees</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">a) Third Party Fees for Using Kilter.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You are also responsible for all third party charges and fees associated with connecting and using the Site, including fees such as internet service provider fees, telephone and computer equipment charges, sales tax and any other fees necessary to access the Site.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4">5. User Payments</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">a) Referral Based Cash Payments.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Kilter’s platform offers its users an opportunity to earn cash for referring new paying users. Payments will be made to the user via PayPal by the seventh (7th) day of the following month. Calculation of owed payments will be determined based on the number of users who have been successfully charged for membership. Any user who has canceled their payment within the cancellation period will not count towards referral payment owed to the user.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">b) Withdrawal of Funds.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Users may withdraw their cash prize awards as well as cash deposits by using the "Withdrawal" option within the User Portal on the Website. Users may be requested to complete an affidavit of eligibility and a liability/publicity release (unless prohibited by law) and/or appropriate tax forms and forms of identification including but not limited to a Driver's License, Proof of Residence, and/or any information relating to payment/deposit accounts as reasonably requested by Kilter, Inc. in order to complete the withdrawal of earnings. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in disqualification and forfeiture of any earnings. Disqualification or forfeiture of any earnings may also occur if it is determined any such user did not comply with these Terms of Use in any manner.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">c) Taxes.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;All taxes associated with the receipt of any referral based earnings are the sole responsibility of the user. In the event that the awarding of any cash to users is challenged by any legal authority, Kilter, Inc. reserves the right in its sole discretion to determine whether or not to award such earnings.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">c) Eligibility.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Eligibility for cash earnings is determined by the users’ membership type. Users paying for membership subscriptions will be eligible for cash earnings, while non-paying users will not be eligible for cash earnings. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4">6.Termination or Modification by Kilter.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">a) Termination or Modification.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You understand and agree that, at any time and without prior notice Kilter may (1) terminate, cancel, deactivate and/or suspend your subscription, your account, any orders placed, or your access to or use of the Site or your membership (or any portion thereof, including your access to any or all Rewards Partners or services) and/or (2) discontinue, modify or alter any aspect, feature or policy of the Site or your subscription. This includes the right to terminate or modify any subscription prior to the end of any pre-paid or committed period. Upon any termination, we may immediately deactivate your account and all related information and/or bar any further access to your account information and the Site. Upon any such termination by us without cause, as your sole recourse, we will issue you a pro rata refund of the prepaid portion of your subscription applicable to future unused services (less any fees or costs for classes or services already used). If we determine that you have violated these Terms or otherwise engaged in illegal or improper use of your membership or the Site, you will not be entitled to any refund and you agree that we will not be responsible to pay any such refund. You agree that Kilter will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination or modification to the service regardless of the reason for such termination or modification. You acknowledge that your only right with respect to any dissatisfaction with any modification or discontinuation of service made by us is to cancel or terminate your subscription.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">b) Infringing or Fraudulent Activity.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Kilter does not permit copyright infringing activities and reserves the right to terminate access to the Site and remove all content submitted by any persons who are found to be infringers. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of the Site may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Kilter may have at law or in equity.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4">7.

Arbitration Agreement</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10 c12">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">a) Purpose.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This Arbitration Agreement facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and Kilter. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their disputes and potential disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It provides that all disputes between you and Kilter shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Entering into this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">For the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, “Kilter” means Kilter and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Kilter regarding any aspect of your relationship with Kilter, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">b) Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Before initiating any Dispute, whether in court or arbitration, you must first give Kilter an opportunity to resolve the Dispute by mailing written notification to Kilter, Legal Department, 316 W. Washington Ave. Suite </span><span class="c8">675</span><sup><a href="https://kilterrewards.com/Terms&amp;Services.html#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c2">, Madison, WI 53713. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of the Dispute, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If Kilter does not resolve the Dispute to your satisfaction within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">c) Arbitration Procedures.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If the Dispute is not resolved as provided above in the Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution section, either you or Kilter may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Arbitration Agreement. For arbitration before the AAA, for Disputes in which less than $75,000 is at issue, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267. In the event that this Arbitration Agreement conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules, this Arbitration Agreement shall govern. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. Because your contract with Kilter, the Terms of Use, and this this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">d) Arbitration Award.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator shall make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by applicable federal law, including but not limited to the Federal Arbitration Act (“the FAA”), and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">e) Location of Arbitration.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Arbitration shall take place in Dane County, Wisconsin, but it may proceed by telephone if you so choose.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">f) Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Kilter will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">g) Class Action Waiver.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Any Disputes arising out of or relating to any purchase you make on or through the Site, any information you provide via the Site, these Terms (including the formation, performance, or alleged breach), and your use of the Site shall be submitted individually by you and will not be subject to any class action or representative status. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) . Neither you, nor any other Member of Kilter and/or user of Kilter services, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney general proceeding with respect to the matters set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph. You agree that this Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any dispute between you and Kilter and is nonseverable from the Arbitration Agreement. If any portion of this Class Action Waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. You understand that by agreeing to this Class Action Waiver, you may only pursue Dispute against Kilter in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">h) Limitation of Procedural Rights.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You understand and agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and Kilter are each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a trial before a judge or jury in a public court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Kilter might otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). By using the Kilter Site and products and services, you are entering into this Arbitration Agreement, and you give up those procedural rights. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration. The right to appellate review of an arbitrator’s decision is much more limited than in court, and in general an arbitrator’s decision may not be appealed for errors of fact or law.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">i) Severability.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If any clause within this Arbitration Agreement, other than the Class Action Waiver clause above, is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">j) Continuation.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of your contract with Kilter and your use of the Kilter Site and services.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c12 c22">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c9 c18"><span class="c12 c15"></span></p><div class="c24"><p class="c20"><a href="https://kilterrewards.com/Terms&amp;Services.html#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a><span class="c5">As above, 675 or 175?</span></p></div></body></html>
